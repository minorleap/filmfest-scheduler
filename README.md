# filmfest-scheduler
Allows film festival attendees to find an optimal schedule of screenings based on their availability and film preference

Parses film, screening, venue and ticket availability data from a popular ticketing platform

Allows users to create an account, indicate the dates of their attendance, view listings of all available films on those dates, select and prioritise the films they wish to see

An original scheduling algorithm (below) is used to generate an optimal schedule while preventing the inclusion of sold-out events and unrealistic travel times between venues

The resulting schedule can be viewed, saved, printed and emailed
